Preforming analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Outcome Based on Launch Date

Per the data the most successful fundraisers in theater occurred in early spring, peaking in the month of May and then declining into the summer months. The outcome of a failed campaign peaked in October; the month of December provided the lowest success rate, perhaps due to the numerous holidays in this timeframe which may have deterred persons from contributing more money.


Outcome Based on Goals

Based on the line graph there were zero canceled fundraisers for those who set the goal to at least $1000.00. The most successful fundraisers did not set their goal too high with the criteria being 80% success at less than $1000.00, this criteria also had the least percentage of fail rate at 20%.
Percentage success significantly dips at $25,000 to $29,999 and then dramatically again at $45,000 to $49,999. That criteria also produces the highest failed percentage at nearly 100%. 


Limitations to Dataset

The data may be limited in that the sample is too large especially concerning country, if it was scaled down to only one country it would give a better analysis of fundraiser goals as well as launch dates. The source of the collected data may also prove to be a limitation as well as the presence of outliers to the data.


Other Possible Tables/Graphs

A graph plotting the amount pledged against the success rate would have shown the intent and enthusiasm of the sample set, rather than just the success rate of a fundraiser actually reaching the goal. The data analysis should have used one country as a constant to build the graphs and analysis.
